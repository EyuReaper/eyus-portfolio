            Hi my name is Eyuel or Eyu for short. As  a developer, my journey is driven by a passion for creating efficient and impactful digital solutions. I thrive on challenges, embracing new technologies and methodologies to build applications that are not only functional but also intuitive and user-friendly. My approach is disciplined and meticulous, reflecting the precision required in modern software development.
          </p>
          <p>
            I specialize in React & Vue.js for robust frontend experiences and leverage Tailwind CSS for rapid, maintainable styling. My skills extend to Nuxt.js, Node.js for backend, databases like MongoDB/PostgreSQL, cloud platforms like AWS/GCP. I am always eager to collaborate on projects that demand creativity, problem-solving, and a commitment to excellence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond coding, I enjoy  reading about  technology & history books, drawing & sketching ,solving puzzles , which further sharpens my analytical thinking, an eye for design and strategic planning  â€” qualities I bring to every development project.
